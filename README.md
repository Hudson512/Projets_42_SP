# 42SP Projects
All projects developed at 42 school São Paulo since May 2021.

> "The 42 program is a college-level software engineering/coding program in a professional environment. There are no classes, teachers, or courses: we use project-based learning, skills mastery, peer-to-peer correction, and gamification to foster learning. Major learning milestones are expressed as levels of experience rather than years; your individual experience sets the pace for learning."

This constellation-like program is divided into two main parts: the core fundamentals program (inner layers), which eventually branches away for complementary specialization paths (outer layer). The core program comprises 16 levels to be beaten, each level granting you new skills and experience in order to progress towards the great Transcendence. From that point on, students are ready to choose a specialization path, or even choose to leave the school and enter the workforce.

_(Projects under the same number are candidates for that level, students must pick only one.)_

## Core - Phase 1

### Level 1 - **[libft](https://github.com/rodsmade/Projets_42_SP/tree/main/projets_obligatoires/1_libft)**
Build your own basic C static library, which will be used throughout the rest of the program. The ```ft_*``` functions mostly mimic the behaviour of the traditional C functions, and must be written using at most ```write()``` and ```malloc()```.

### Level 2 - **[get_next_line](https://github.com/rodsmade/Projets_42_SP/tree/main/projets_obligatoires/2_get_next_line)**
	Read from a file descriptor and deliver one line, that is, a ```\n```-terminated string of chars.
	This project is later incorporated into Libft.

### Level 3 - **[ft_printf](https://github.com/rodsmade/Projets_42_SP/tree/main/projets_obligatoires/3_printf)**
	Build your own version of ```printf```!
	This project is later incorporated into Libft.

### Level 4 - **[born2beroot](https://github.com/rodsmade/Projets_42_SP/tree/main/projets_obligatoires/4_born2beroot)**
	Set up an SSH server running on Linux with basic system administration, strong password rules, encryption, and more.

### Level 5 - **fractol / fdf / [so_long](https://github.com/rodsmade/Projets_42_SP/tree/main/projets_obligatoires/5_so_long)**
	First steps intto rendering graphics on the screen! Choose to render either fractals, 3D wireframes or a 2D top-down video game.

### Level 6 - **minitalk / pipex**
	TBA.

## Core - Phase 2
### Level 7 - **push_swap**
	TBA.

### Level 8 - **minishell**
	TBA.

### Level 9 - **Philosophers**
	TBA.

### Level 10 - **netpractice**
	TBA.

### Level 11 - **cub3d / minirt**
	TBA.

## Core - Phase 3
### Level 12 - **CPP Modules (OOP)**
	TBA.

### Level 13 - **ft_containers**
	TBA.

### Level 14 - **inception**
	TBA.

### Level 15 - **webservices / ft_irc**
	TBA.

### Level 16 - **Transcendence**
	TBA.
