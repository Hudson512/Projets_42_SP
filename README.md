> "The 42 program is a college-level software engineering/coding program in a professional environment. There are no classes, teachers, or courses: we use project-based learning, skills mastery, peer-to-peer correction, and gamification to foster learning. Major learning milestones are expressed as levels of experience rather than years; your individual experience sets the pace for learning."

This constellation-like program is divided into two main parts: the core fundamentals program (inner layers), which eventually branches away for complementary specialization paths (outer layer). The core program comprises 16 levels to be beaten, each level granting you new skills and experience in order to progress towards the great Transcendence. From that point on, students are ready to choose a specialization path, or even choose to leave the school and enter the workforce.

_(Projects under the same number are candidates for that level, students must pick only one.)_

## Core - Phase 1!


### Level 1 - **[libft](https://github.com/rodsmade/Libft-42sp)**
	Build your own basic C static library, which will be used throughout the rest of the program. The ```ft_*``` functions mostly mimic the behaviour of the traditional C functions, and must be written using at most ```write()``` and ```malloc()```.

### Level 2 - **[get_next_line](https://github.com/rodsmade/Get_Next_Line-42sp)**
	Read from a file descriptor and deliver one line, that is, a ```\n```-terminated string of chars.
	This project is later incorporated into Libft.

### Level 3 - **[ft_printf](https://github.com/rodsmade/Ft_Printf-42sp.git)**
	Build your own version of ```printf```!
	This project is later incorporated into Libft.

### Level 4 - **[born2beroot](https://github.com/rodsmade/Born2BeRoot-42sp)**
	Set up an SSH server running on Linux with basic system administration, strong password rules, encryption, and more.

### Level 5 - **fractol / fdf / [so_long](https://github.com/rodsmade/So_long-42sp)**
	First steps into rendering graphics on the screen! A choice between rendering either fractals, 3D wireframes or a 2D top-down video game.

### Level 6 - **minitalk / [pipex](https://github.com/rodsmade/Pipex-42sp)**
	An intro to Unix Processes in C.
	A choice between having a client/server pair of processes exchanging info (strings of characters), or simulating the pipe (|) command in Bash using pipes and forks in C.

## Core - Phase 2
### Level 7 - **[push_swap](https://github.com/rodsmade/Push_Swap-42sp.git)**
	Sorting algorithms and stacks.
	A list of unordered numbers must be taken in and sorted out, with a twist: the numbers must be sorted by means of using exactly two stacks and a set of 11 stipulated stack operations.

### Level 8 - **[minishell](https://github.com/rodsmade/Minishell-42sp)**
	A minified verion of a Bash shell written in C.
	Including basic parsing of pipes and redirections, and built-ins and support for commands execution via $PATH or absolute path.

### Level 9 - **[Philosophers](https://github.com/rodsmade/Philosophers-42sp)**
	Multithreading in C.
	Solving the famous dining philosophers problem proposed by Dijkstra.

### Level 10 - **netpractice**
	Networking and routing.
	A set of problems simulating LAN's and networks with internet access. A basic understanding of IP addresses and routing tables is needed to solve each and every problem in under 15 minutes altogether.

### Level 11 - **[cub3d](https://github.com/rodsmade/Cub3D-42sp) / minirt**
	Raycasting and Raytracing.
	Deeper study of graphics computing using a LibX interface to code either of a raycasting or a raytracing engine.

## Core - Phase 3
### Level 12 - **CPP Modules (OOP)**
	TBA.

### Level 13 - **ft_containers**
	TBA.

### Level 14 - **inception**
	TBA.

### Level 15 - **webservices / ft_irc**
	TBA.

### Level 16 - **Transcendence**
	TBA.
